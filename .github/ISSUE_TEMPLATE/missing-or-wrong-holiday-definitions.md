Provide as much detail as possible about missing or wrong holiday definitions. Only official holidays are taken into consideration.
Have a look at the documentation, so you know what kind of information is required to define the holiday. If you are not sure, just describe with your own words:

- Country/State/Region/City:
- Type of holiday:
- When does the holiday occur?
- In which cases is the holiday moved?

If possible, also provide the legal basis for your request.
